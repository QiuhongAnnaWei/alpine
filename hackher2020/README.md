# Hack(H)er413 2020: Alpine
Our project Alpine is a Web App that provides Alzheimer's patients with an easy-to-use and visually stimulating platform to train and retain their memory of family members. This tool built with React and has 3 major functionality: taking input of family member's information, generating flash cards for each family member, automatically creating quizzes for the user to practice their knowledge.

Inspired by one of our teammates' grandparent's personal experience with Alzheimer's, we hope to communicate that the disease is like a mounntain, and the alpine journey of overcoming the hardship, though arduous, is not impossible.
