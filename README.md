# Hack(H)er413 2020: Alpine
This project is created by Anna Wei and Livia Zhu for Hack(H)er413 2020.

Alpine is a Web App that provides Alzheimer's patients with an easy-to-use and visually stimulating platform to train and retain their memory of family members. This tool built with React has 3 major functionality: taking input of family member's information, generating flash cards for each family member, and automatically creating quizzes for the user to practice their knowledge.

Inspired by the personal experience of one of our teammates' grandparents, we choose the name Alpline for this project because we hope to communicate that though the alpine journey of overcoming the hardship of Alzheimer's is arduous, it is not impossible.
